<p align="center"> ðŸ§˜ Simple durable Datalog database for everyone ðŸ’½ </p>

## :hear_no_evil: What and why

Datalevin is a port of [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) in-memory database and Datalog query
engine to work on top of [Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database).

The rationale for Datalevin is to provide a simple and free Datalog engine running on durable storage.  It is my observation that many developers prefer the flavor of Datalog populized by [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com) over any flavor of SQL, once they get to use it.  The automatic implict joins seem to be its killer feature.

> I love Datalog, why haven't everyone use this already? 

Datomic is an enterprise software and its feature sets may be an overkill for many use cases. One thing that often confuses novice users is its temporal features. To keep things simple and familiar, Datalevin does not keep transaction history, and behaves the same way as most other databases: when data are deleted, they are gone.

Datalevin retains the library property of Datascript, and it is meant to be embedded in applications to manage state. Because data is persistent on disk in Datalevin, application state can survive application restarts and data size can be larger than memory.  

Datalevin relies on LMDB's robust transactional database design and leverages its high performance for concurrent read intensive workloads. As a battle tested data store, LMDB is used in [many projects](https://symas.com/lmdb/technical/#projects), e.g. it powers [Cloadflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-quicksilver-configuration-distribution-at-internet-scale/) global configuration distribution. In addition to fast read, LMDB performs well in writing large values (> 2KB). Therefore, unlike some alternatives, it is fine to store large values in Datalevin. 

Datalevin can also be used as a key-value store without Datalog. Datalevin supports full features of LMDB and we are committed to make Datalevin as efficient as possible. A number of optimizatons are put in place. For instance, it uses a transaction pool to enable transaction reuse, pre-allocates buffers, and so on. 

## :tada: Usage


## :floppy_disk: Difference from Datascript

In addition to the diffrence in data durability, Datalevin differs from Datascript in the following ways:

* Does not store transaction ids. Since history is not kept, there is no need to store transanction ids.

* Entity ids are 64 bits long, so as to support a much larger data size.  

* Has an additional index that uses values as the primary key (VAE), similar to Datomic.

* Indices respect `:db/valueType`. Currently, most Datomic value types are supported, except bigint, bigdec, uri and tuple. Values with unspecified type are treated as [EDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Data_Notation) blobs, and are de/serialized with nippy. 

* Attributes have internal integer ids. 

* Handles schema migrations with `swap-attr` function. It allows safe migration that does not alter existing data (e.g. one to many cardinaity, unique to non-unique, index to non-index and vice vesa), and refuses unsafe schema changes (e.g. many to one cardinality, non-unique to unique, value type changes) that are inconsistent with existing data.

* Datalevin currently only supports Clojure on JVM, but adding support for other Clojure-hosting runtimes is possible in the future, since bindings for LMDB exist in almost all major languages and available on most platforms.

## :baby: Limitations

* Attribute names have a length limitation: an attribute name cannot be more than 511 bytes long, due to LMDB key size limit.

* The maximum individual value size is 4GB. In practice, value size is determined by LMDB's ability to find large enough continous space on disk and Datelevin's ability to pre-allocate off-heap buffers in JVM for them. 

* The total data size of a Datalevin database has the same limit as LMDB's, e.g. 128TB on a modern 64-bit machine that implements 48-bit address spaces.

* Because keys are compared bitwisely, for range queries to work as expected on an attribute, its `:db/valueType` should be specified.

* As mentioned, Datalevin does not support transaction history.

* Currently, there's no network interface. 

## :shopping: Alternatives

If you are interested in using the dialect of Datalog pioneered by Datomic, here are your current options:

* If you need a simple durable store with a battle tested backend, give [Datalevin](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin) a try.

* If you need an in-memory store, e.g. for single page applications running in a browser, [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) is for you.

* If you need time travel and rich features backed by the authors of Clojure, you should use [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com).

* If you need features such as bitemporal graph queries, You may try [Crux](https://github.com/juxt/crux).

* If you don't mind experimental storage backend, you may try [Datahike](https://github.com/replikativ/datahike).

* There was also [Eva](https://github.com/Workiva/eva/), a distributed store, but it is no longer in active development.
