# DataLightning

A port of [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript) in-memory database and Datalog query
engine on top of [Lightning Memory-Mapped Data Manager
(LMDB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database).

Similar to Datascript, Datalightling is a library, meant to be embedded in applications to
manage state. However, the data is persistent on disk, so the state survives
application restarts and the data size can be larger than memory. LMDB's lightweight and crash free design together with its fast read performance
is well suited as the durable storage for Datalightning.

Datalightning currently only supports Clojure, but we plan to add ClojureScript and JS support
in the future as node.js bindings for LMDB exist.
