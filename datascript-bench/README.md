# Benchmark

This contains the original benchmarks from [Datascript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), with code for Datalevin added.

To run the benchmarks, you need to have both [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) and [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) installed on your system already. Then run these commands in the project root directory.

```
lein javac
cd bench
./bench.clj
```
