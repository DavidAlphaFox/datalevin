# Benchmark

This is the original benchmark from Datascript.

To run the benchmarks, you need to have the [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) on your ssystem.

```
./bench.clj
```

Some of the benchmarks are commented out for they may takes a long time to run. You can comment out the appropriate lines in `default-benchmarks` in bench.clj to run them.
