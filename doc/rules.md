# Datalevin Rules Engine

Datalevin has an innovative rule engine that implements an efficient rules
evaluation strategy that leverage the cost based query optimizer. It also
includes a novel provenance based mechanism for incremental maintenance.

## Motivation

The power of Datalog compared to a relational query language lies in the
expressiveness in handling logical rules that can be recursively defined.
However, the logic syntax of traditional Datalog may feel alien and hard to
grasp for some developers. Datomic flavor of Datalog is beneficial, not just in
term of its Clojuristic syntax, but more so in its marrying the traditional
SQL-like structure with traditional Datalog. By using the SQL-like syntax as the
basis and treating traditional Datalog syntax as special rule clauses, users are
gradually introduced to this logic view of Datalog, a win in ergonomics.

The previous implementation of rule clause evaluation algorithm inherited from
Datascript uses a top-down evaluation strategy, which can be less efficient than
a bottom-up strategy [4]. More importantly, this implementation cannot take
advantage of our cost based query optimizer, so its performance is far from
competitive. To address this deficiency, we developed a new rules evaluation
engine using the latest research advances in bottom-up Datalog evaluation
strategy, with some innovation of our own.

## Rule Evaluation

### Pull-out of non-recursive rule clauses (new)

As an innovation, we identify the clauses that are not involved in recursions,
pull them out and add them to the regular query clauses to allow the cost-based
query optimizer to work on them. That is to say, the rule engine mainly works on
the rules that involved in recursions. This optimization not just simplifies the
rules, but also reduces the number of datoms the rule engine has to process.
This enjoys the benefits of the rule rewrite algorithms such as magic sets,
while avoiding potential slow-down due to increased number of rules brought by
the rewrite.

### Recursive rule resolution

Datalevin rule engine uses the semi-naive Datalog evaluation strategy as the
basis [1] [2]. It mainly follows the abstraction proposed in Temporel [3], which
supports free mixing of negation/aggregation within recursions. This allows
efficient processing of highly expressive rules, e.g. Datalog can now be used to
implement sophisticated machine learning algorithms, beyond the traditional
logical and graph processing tasks.
